# ArduinoDue_RealTimeExperiment

# OVERVIEW: 
The following program is a predictive peak / trough detection routine for the purpose of capturing physiologically relevant signal attributes in Local Field Potential Data. Specifically, this project is aimed at real-time prediction and stimulation of peaks and troughs for the Theta brainwave (between 4 and 12 Hz.) 

# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
You can find the technical specifications in the Platform Guide document within this repository.
